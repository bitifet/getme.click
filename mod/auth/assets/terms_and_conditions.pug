    p This service #[mark is offered freely and “as-is,”] without any guarantees of availability, reliability, or future support.
    p: b By using this site, you agree to:
    ul
        li Use it legally according to the laws of your country, my country, and the country where the service is hosted.
        li Not engage in any activity that could cause legal or reputational harm.
    p I reserve the right to block or delete accounts that violate these rules, at my sole discretion.
    p #[mark Your personal data will only be used to provide the service] and will never be shared or exploited for other purposes.
    p Tools to #[mark download your data] may be provided as time and resources allow (But there is none yet).
    p This project is currently supported only by advertising revenue, and I cannot (yet) guarantee its continuous operation or future development at this time.
    p However, if the project grows, I intend to progressively add warranties, improvements, and more user rights — without abandoning the original #[mark spirit of being a user-oriented, respectful service].
    p Our philosophy is to serve users by offering useful, non-intrusive tools — not by locking you in, exploiting your data, or creating dependencies.
    p #[b Thank you] for your trust and understanding — and for being part of this community!
